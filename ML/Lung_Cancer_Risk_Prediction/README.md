# ü©ª Lung Cancer Risk Prediction

This classification project predicts whether an individual is at high or low risk of developing lung cancer based on health indicators, symptoms, and lifestyle factors.  
A Random Forest classifier is used for high accuracy and explainability.

---

## üéØ Objective

To detect and classify lung cancer risk early by analyzing:
- Smoking & alcohol consumption
- Pollution exposure
- Cough frequency, fatigue level, and chronic symptoms

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Early-stage detection is critical in improving outcomes for lung cancer.  
This model helps flag high-risk individuals for further clinical evaluation.
