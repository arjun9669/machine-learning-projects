## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage behavior, support interactions, and payment patterns.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and includes the following features:

- `Age`, `Gender`, `Tenure`
- `Usage Frequency`, `Support Calls`, `Payment Delay`
- `Subscription Type`, `Contract Length`
- `Total Spend`, `Last Interaction`
- `Churn` (Target: 0 = Not Churned, 1 = Churned)

📄 Files:
- `customer_churn.csv` — input dataset
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook
