## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Mall retailers want to understand their customers better so they can market to distinct groups differently.  
This project segments customers into clusters using their:
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1â€“100)`

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb` â€” Notebook with clustering analysis
- `mall_customers.csv` â€” Dataset containing demographic and purchase data

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Tasks

- Data preprocessing & label encoding (Gender)
- Visualizations (scatter plots, cluster views)
- Elbow Method to choose optimal `k`
- K-Means model building & cluster labeling

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- ðŸ“Œ Elbow Method plot  
- ðŸ“Œ Customer clusters based on income and spending  
- ðŸ“Œ Gender-based spending distribution

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjun9669/machine-learning-projects.git
cd ML/Customer_Segmentation_KMeans
jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation_KMeans.ipynb
